* Probability and Statistics Reading List

A compilation of books for learning probability and statistics from scratch.

** Some notes

This repository contains an analysis of the commonly recommended books for learning probability and statistics from around the web.

One thing to keep in mind is that advanced mathematics in areas like analysis and measure theory might become more important as we delve deeper into topics. Or may be even before that since things are deeply intertwined all across math. Some of the close adjacent areas to explore after this seems to be information theory, and statistical mechanics/thermodynamics as they can be seen commonly sprucing up in books addressing the topics of probability that I have examined here. I have attempt to put the link to resources directly to those that are freely available and included Amazon affiliate links to others. I have also attempt to link to the places where the resource was recommended from.

TODO: Tag the resources that are free using an icon/tag

** On the Categorization

The books have been organized into 3 sections, that are ordered as: Introductory → Elementary → Rigorous. The various books I have sampled are categorized into these three sections and within these sections, the books are unordered, which means, I don’t recommend any sequence of reading them inside these broader categories.

Apart from these, as adjuncts, I have also added some history books and topics that are adjacent to probability and statistics one might enjoy learning.

Within the Elementary section, I have tried to categorize the books along 2 axes, { logical, empirical } × { visual, symbolic }.

By a symbolic vs. visual approach, I intend to cover those which take a rigorous algebraic approach vs. ones that lean in on geometric/structural intuition of the concepts at play. These are not mutually exclusive categories and books are situated in a spectrum. With logical vs. empirical approach, I intend to locate those books that have an inclination towards describing the underlying formal patterns as deriving from a rational understanding of the space vs. a more data oriented one where case studies from real world are presented and inferences are inducted from this space.  Whenever there was an inclination towards either poles, I have done a rounding off and put it off to align with one of the poles. So even when reading a book classified as say, logical/visual, there is good chance that it will have a good amount of symbolic knowledge to teach you. 

For statistics, I have tried to mention whether the books take a frequentist or Bayesian approach with the same caveat of mutual inclusion of ideas as above.

Even though, this is a simplistic division and fails to capture the actual complexity of concepts in probability and statistics, it is the best provisional axes I could supply to make sense of these fields. Once my comprehension of the landscape improves, I will try to adapt/revise the bases to have better span and decomposition properties accordingly.

TODO: May be include a 2 × 2 of the book distribution?

TODO: After listing this out, I have felt that may be a better categorization would be { conceptual, computational } × { probability, statistics }. This would have the books that give a conceptual grounding primarily vs. one that has a lot of exercises to solve which would help the reader arrive at an understanding for the relations at play. Try to do this after you put up the concept lattice for the chapters in the second or third pass.

** Overview of topics covered

TODO: Add in later by codifying the data on how different books treat different topics.

* Introductory Works

These are the introductory works into the topic. The books here are popular introductory works into probability which doesn’t get down into the nitty gritty and as such reading these should be supplemented with more rigorous works. They are added here so that an interested reader who is totally new to this domain can build context and familiarize themselves with the central ideas of this field. This also includes some computational notebooks by Peter Norvig which could be of great help in trying to get hands dirty with the algorithms that one uses when trying to navigate the landscape of probability and statistics.

An online book that provides visual intuition into the ideas of probability along with a good ground work for the mathematical symbolic language that undergirds modern probability theory. The topics are touched upon in a rather cursory manner and might need the support of some other books to thoroughly unravel the underpinnings.

An interactive website introducing the concepts of probability and statistics.

* History

An overview of the history would benefit by providing the motivation and original scenarios in which the concepts originated. They are also a good way for people looking to research into this area to understand some of the original strands and possible find a wealth of problems that are linked with the genesis of the ideas.

A standard recommendation to learn about the origins of probability ad statistics. This book, along with [[https://amzn.to/3dalnuF][The Emergence of Probability]] by Hacking, which has a more philosophical bent, might serve as a decent bundle for exposure to the historical details on how probability took shape as a science.
